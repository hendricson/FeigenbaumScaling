# Method for Calculating Feigenbaum's Scaling Constant For One-Dimensional Discrete Maps

This is one of the mini-projects I did for one of the Numerical Methods classes I took. The program is written in Matlab and it calculates Feigenbaum's scaling constant using the algorithm suggested by Keith Briggs.
